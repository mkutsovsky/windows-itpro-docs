# Reduce attack surfaces with Windows Defender Exploit Guard 


**Applies to:**

- Windows 10 Insider Preview 

[!include[Prerelease information](prerelease.md)]

**Audience**

- Enterprise security administrators


**Manageability available with**

- Group Policy
- PowerShell
- Configuration service providers for mobile device management


Attack Surface Reduction helps prevent actions and apps that are typically used by exploit-seeking malware to infect machines. 

It is part of [Windows Defender Exploit Guard](windows-defender-exploit-guard.md).

Attack Surface Reduction works best with [Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection](../windows-defender-atp/windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection.md) - which gives you detailed reporting into Windows Defender EG events and blocks as part of the usual [alert investigation scenarios](../windows-defender-atp/investigate-alerts-windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection.md).

The feature is comprised of a number of rules, each of which target specific behaviors that are typically used by malware and malicious apps to infect machines, such as:

- Executable files and scripts used in Office apps or web mail that attempt to download or run files
- Scripts that are obfuscated or otherwise suspicious
- Behaviors that apps undertake that are not usually inititated during normal day-to-day work

See the [Attack Surface Reduction rules](#attack-surface-reduction-rules) section in this topic for more information on each rule.

When a rule is triggered, a notification will be displayed from the Action Center. You can [customize the notification](customize-attack-surface-reduction.md#customize-the-notification) with your company details and contact information. You can also enable the rules individually to customize what techniques the feature monitors.

You can also use [audit mode](audit-windows-defender-exploit-guard.md) to evaluate how Attack Surface Reduction would impact your organization if it were enabled.

## Attack Surface Reduction rules

The following sections describe what each rule does. Each rule is identified by a rule GUID, as in the following table:

Rule name | GUIDs 
-|-
Block executable content from email client and webmail | BE9BA2D9-53EA-4CDC-84E5-9B1EEEE46550
Block Office applications from creating child processes | D4F940AB-401B-4EFC-AADC-AD5F3C50688A
Block Office applications from creating executable content  | 3B576869-A4EC-4529-8536-B80A7769E899
Block Office applications from injecting into other processes | 75668C1F-73B5-4CF0-BB93-3ECF5CB7CC84
Impede JavaScript and VBScript to launch executables | D3E037E1-3EB8-44C8-A917-57927947596D
Block execution of potentially obfuscated scripts  | 5BEB7EFE-FD9A-4556-801D-275E5FFC04CC
Block Win32 imports from Macro code in Office | 92E97FA1-2EDF-4476-BDD6-9DD0B4DDDC7B


### Rule: Block executable content from email client and webmail


This rule blocks the following file types from being run or launched from an email seen in either Microsoft Outlook or webmail (such as Gmail.com or Outlook.com):

- Executable files (such as .exe, .dll, or .scr) 
- Script files (such as a PowerShell .ps, VisualBasic .vbs, or JavaScript .js file)
- Script archive files



### Rule: Block Office applications from creating child processes

Office apps, such as Word or Excel, will not be allowed to create child processes. 

This is a typical malware behavior, especially for macro-based attacks that attempt to use Office apps to launch or download malicious executables.

### Rule: Block Office applications from creating executable content

This rule targets typical behaviors used by suspicious and malicious add-ons and scripts (extensions) that create or launch executable files. This is a typical malware technique.

Extensions will be blocked from being used by Office apps. Typically these extensions use the Windows Scripting Host (.wsh files) to run scripts that automate certain tasks or provide user-created add-on features.


### Rule: Block Office applications from injecting into other processes


Office apps, such as Word, Excel, or PowerPoint, will not be able to inject code into other processes. 

This is typically used by malware to run malicious code in an attempt to hide the activity from antivirus scanning engines.



### Rule: Impede JavaScript and VBScript to launch executables

JavaScript and VBScript scripts can be used by malware to launch other malicious apps. 

This rule prevents these scripts from being allowed to launch apps, thus preventing malicious use of the scripts to spread malware and infect machines.



### Rule: Block execution of potentially obfuscated scripts

Malware and other threats can attempt to obfuscate or hide their malicious code in some script files. 

This rule prevents scripts that appear to be obfuscated from running. 

It uses the [AntiMalwareScanInterface (AMSI)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn889587(v=vs.85).aspx) to determine if a script is potentially obfuscated, and then blocks such a script, or blocks scripts when an attempt is made to access them.





## Requirements

The following requirements must be met before Attack Surface Reduction will work:

Windows 10 version | Windows Defender Antivirus
- | -
Insider Preview build 16232 or later (dated July 1, 2017 or later) | [Windows Defender AV real-time protection](../windows-defender-antivirus/configure-real-time-protection-windows-defender-antivirus.md) must be enabled




## Review Attack Surface Reduction events in Windows Event Viewer

You can review the Windows event log to see events that are created when an Attack Surface Reduction rule is triggered (or audited):

1. Download the [Exploit Guard Evaluation Package](https://aka.ms/mp7z2w) and extract the file *asr-events.xml* to an easily accessible location on the machine.

1. Type **Event viewer** in the Start menu to open the Windows Event Viewer.

2. On the left panel, under **Actions**, click **Import custom view...**

    ![](images/events-import.gif)

3. Navigate to the Exploit Guard Evaluation Package, and select the file *asr-events.xml*. Alternatively, [copy the XML directly](event-views-exploit-guard.md).

4. Click **OK**.

5. This will create a custom view that filters to only show the following events related to Attack Surface Reduction:

 Event ID | Description
-|-
5007 | Event when settings are changed
1122 | Event when rule fires in Audit-mode 
1121 | Event when rule fires in Block-mode 



### Event fields

- **ID**: matches with the Rule-ID that triggered the block/audit.
- **Detection time**: Time of detection
- **Process Name**: The process that performed the "operation" that was blocked/audited
- **Description**: Additional details about the event or audit, including the signature, engine, and product version of Windows Defender Antivirus
